<h2>#Login Page<h2>
        This is a simple login page that includes username/email, password fields, and a "Remember Me" checkbox.
        The project validates user input and displays error messages if the input is invalid. Additionally, 
        it uses a loading spinner during form submission and provides an eye icon to toggle the visibility of the password.
  
<h3>#Files</h3>
     - `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the login page.
     - `styles.css`: The CSS file that styles the login page.
     - `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles form validation and submission.
